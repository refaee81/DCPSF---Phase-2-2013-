# DCPSF---Phase-2-2013-
Darfur Community Peace and Stability Fund was set up to address community level conflicts peacebuilding activities and foster social cohesion by drawing diverse communities together through processes of dialogue and consultations and address root causes of conflict through various activities that provide dividends of peace in Darfur. 
DCPSF has been operating with the sole goal of building trust and confidence of conflicting community since its inception in 2008. DCPSF Phase 2, which covers from 2011 to 2015, continues with the same goal to stabilize communities and restore trust and confidence between communities paving the way towards early recovery. In doing so, the DCPSF is expected to contribute to inclusive and sustainable Darfur-wide peace negotiations through local level peace and stability. 
A particular requirement of each implementing partner is that sound conflict analysis is carried out ahead of programming. To aid our potential partners, DCPSF has in the past two years carried out Darfur wide conflict analysis workshops and draw from different actors in Darfur, the hotspots, issues of conflict and actors of conflict from which DCPSF is able to prioritize thematic issues to be addressed.

Following are the findings of the root socio-economic factors analysis carried out in 2013 with a lens of community level conflicts and their actors.
